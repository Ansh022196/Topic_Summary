about 40 percent cumulative electric power installed capacity from nonfossil fuelbased energy resources by the year 2030 therefore electric vehicles are the way forward for indian transport and we must switch to them now electric vehicles are easy to drive and quiet electric vehicles don’t have gears and are very convenient to drive there are no complicated controls just accelerate brake and steer when you want to charge your vehicle just plug it in to a home or public charger electric vehicles are also quiet so they reduce noise pollution that traditional vehicles contribute to convenience of charging at home imagine being at a busy fuel station during peak hours and you are getting late to reach your workplace these problems can easily be overcome with an electric vehicle simply plug your vehicle in at your home charger for 45 hours before you plan to go if you are able to get a charger where you park at home it is very convenient to plan your journeys in advance what if you forget to plug in your machine someday then you can easily take the help of fast chargers or even battery swapping services if you are on a twowheeler on the road no noise pollution electric vehicles have the silent functioning capability as there is no engine under the hood but then you have to add in the production of the battery estimates suggest that 150kg of co2 are released for every 1 kilowatt hour kwh of battery capacity for an electric car to have a decent range say 300 miles between charges it needs a battery that’s at least 60kwh in capacity this means that a further 9 tonnes of co2 will be emitted during the making of an electric car giving a total of 1619 tonnes of co2 emitted so at this point an electric car seems worse for the environment than a fossil fuel onethey are only as green as their power sourcesthe environmental impact of an electric car can increase or decrease considerably depending on how the electricity that charges its battery is made a coalfired power station emits 800850 grams of co2 per kwh recent estimates suggest this may be lower at 650g per kwh whilst a cleaner gasfired power station emits 350400g co2 per kwh using renewable energy like solar panels or wind turbines around 36g co2 is emitted per kwh taking into account the emissions created during their manufacturing process so if a car is recharged using renewable energy its negative impact on the environment is far lower than if it’s charged using electricity from a coalfired power station electric cars can be expensive to buythe purchase price of electric cars does tend to behigher than a petrol or dieselengined version of the same ca
